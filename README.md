# IBM Data Science Capstone Project
## Venue Based Similarity Measures in East-Central London & Birmingham

This project analyses the spatial arrangement of venues in two different cities.It uses data of venues in the k-means clustering to obtain valueable information for increasing revenue/profit margins of new opening restaurants by looking at placements and competitions present in the area. This data analysis can be useful for Civil engineers and government to pick optimum location to expand residential areas. Furthermore, job seekers can narrow down areas where the skills are highly valued.
